- Monday 06/18 (Setup, ill-posedness):
  - Setup cloud access, intro to jupyter and notebooks
  - [Ill-posedness](https://github.com/g2s3-2018/labs/blob/master/Labs/Lab1_Monday/inverseProblemPrototype.ipynb)

- Tuesday 06/19 (FEM and FEniCS):
  - Brief intro on Finite Element Methods (*Umberto* or *Georg*)
  - Handout log in information (*Umberto*)
  - Introduction to FEniCS (Poisson Equation in 1D/2D and FE convergence rates); (*Umberto*)
     - [Poisson Equation in 1D](https://github.com/g2s3-2018/labs/blob/master/Labs/Lab2_Tuesday/Poisson1D.ipynb)
     - [Convergence rates](https://github.com/g2s3-2018/labs/blob/master/Labs/Lab2_Tuesday/ConvergenceRates.ipynb)
     - [Poisson Equation in 2D](https://github.com/g2s3-2018/labs/blob/master/Labs/Lab2_Tuesday/Poisson2D.ipynb)
  - **Hands on exercise**: Change variational form, b.c., etc.
  
- Wednesday 06/20 (FEniCS): 
  - Calculus of Variation: [Unconstrained Energy Minimization](https://github.com/g2s3-2018/labs/blob/master/Labs/Lab3_Wednesday/UnconstrainedMinimization.ipynb). (*Umberto*)
  - Optional TV-denoising
  
- Thursday 06/21 (hIPPYlib):
  - Deterministic Inversion: Steepest Descent Algorithm for Inverse Permeability Poisson Problem (*Umberto*):
    - see [here](https://github.com/g2s3-2018/labs/blob/master/Labs/Lab4_Thursday/Poisson_SD.ipynb)
  - Deterministic Inversion: Inexaxt Newton-CG Algorithm for Inverse Permeability Poisson Problem (*Umberto*):
    - see [here](https://github.com/g2s3-2018/labs/blob/master/Labs/Lab4_Thursday/Poisson_INCG.ipynb)
  - **Hands on exercise**:
    - Mesh refinement study and number of Newton/SD iterations
    - Extends the above codes to an advection diffusion problem
   
- Friday 06/22 (MUQ):
  - Simple examples in Bayesian computation and MC methods (*Matt*)
  
- Monday 06/25 (MUQ):
  - MCMC for low dimensional ODE problems (e.g. the Maple Syroup problem) (*Matt*)
  
- Tuesday 06/26 (MUQ & maybe hIPPYlib):
  - MCMC for high dimensional PDEs problems (Poisson Log Permeability): Hopefully we will present the hIPPYlib/MUQ integration, if not this will be a MUQ-only demonstration. (*Matt*)
  
- Wednesday 06/27:
  - Bayesian Inversion in hIPPYlib: Linearized Inference of Log permeability (*Umberto*).
    - see [here](https://github.com/g2s3-2018/labs/blob/master/Labs/Lab8_Wednesday/SubsurfaceBayesian.ipynb)

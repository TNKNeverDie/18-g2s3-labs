  - [Inverse problem prototype](notebooks/inverseProblemPrototype.html): An illustrative example of an ill-posed inverse problem ( [.ipynb](https://github.com/g2s3-2018/labs/blob/master/Labs/Lab1_Monday/inverseProblemPrototype.ipynb) )

- **Finite element method, calculus of variations, image denoising** (Tuesday 06/19):
  - [Poisson2D](notebooks/Poisson2D.html): Finite element solution of the Poisson equation in 2D using FEniCS ([.ipynb](https://github.com/g2s3-2018/labs/blob/master/Labs/Lab2_Tuesday/Poisson2D.ipynb) )
  - [Convergence rates](notebooks/ConvergeRates2D.html): Convergence rates of the finite element method for the Poisson equation in 2D ([.ipynb](https://github.com/g2s3-2018/labs/blob/master/Labs/Lab2_Tuesday/ConvergenceRates2D.ipynb))
  - [Unconstrained minimization](notebooks/UnconstrainedMinimization.html): This notebook illustrates the minimization of a non-quadratic energy functional using Netwon Method ([.ipynb](https://github.com/g2s3-2018/labs/blob/master/Labs/Lab3_Wednesday/UnconstrainedMinimization.ipynb))
  - [Image denoising](notebooks/ImageDenoising.html): This notebook illustrate the use of Tikhonov and Total Variation regularization to solve an image denoising problem ([.ipynb](https://github.com/g2s3-2018/labs/blob/master/Labs/Lab2_Tuesday/ImageDenoising/ImageDenoising.ipynb))
  
- **Deterministic Inversion** (Thursday 06/21):
  - [Poisson SD](notebooks/Poisson_SD.html): This notebook illustrates the use of hIPPYlib/fenics for solving a determinisitc inverse problem for the coefficient field of a Poisson equation, using the steepest descent method
  ([.ipynb](https://github.com/g2s3-2018/labs/blob/master/Labs/Lab4_Thursday/Poisson_SD.ipynb) ). *Note that SD is a poor choice of optimization method for this problem; it is provided here in order to compare with Newtonâ€™s method in the notebook below*
